** Thanks

*** Thanks to [[https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh][ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh]]
The theme duplicates many code from [[https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/lib/theme-and-appearance.zsh][ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/lib/theme-and-appearance.zsh]] and [[https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/themes/awesomepanda.zsh-theme][ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/themes/awesomepanda.zsh-theme]]. I only modify prompt and add different logos for different OS/user. Thanks to Robby Russell and ohmyzsh's contributors.
